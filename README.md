# Lintella-Language-translation
This project extends the translator for the Lintilla programming language.
The new translations allows the Lintilla compiler to generate code for logical operators (and, or and not), array operations and for loops.

The Lintilla translator targets a simple abstract machine which is a version of Landin’s highly influential SECD machine. 
An implementation of this machine is provided, so the program is able to run Lintilla programs.
